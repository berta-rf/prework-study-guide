        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage (metadata, not visible to user).</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>With visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag 
            (angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside - example: &lt;head&gt;content&lt;/head&gt;). 
            We insert the content between an opening tag and a closing tag so that the browser 
            understands how to treat the content.</li>
          <li>The &lt;title&gt; element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important 
            for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>When using a class attribute as selector we can assign any CSS rule to selected HTML elements.</li>
          <li>A CSS rule is formed by selector + declaration block 
            (one or many declarations of property+value -> ex.'color: blue;').</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git add: adds modifications in current working branch to staging area 
            (either list items one by one or git add -A: adds all changes).</li>
          <li>git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE": adds a description of what the commit contains.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: good to check we have latest version of the project in our local computer.</li>
          <li>git push origin "branch-name": pushes the changes made locally to the remote GitHub branch.</li>

          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. 
            A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. 
            When you define a body of code as a function it will execute when you call the function name in your code.</li>
